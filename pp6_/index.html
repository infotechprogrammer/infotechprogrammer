        <h3 class="faq-title">What language to learn first?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          If you want to explore all programming concepts deeply then you can
          learn C++ also for game development. But if you want to make websites
          so learn JavaScript first, otherwise for android applications or
          system softwares learn Java first, other than that if you want your
          future in Data Science and Artifiacial Intelligence then go with
          python.

        <h3 class="faq-title">Why shouldn't we learn python first?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          It make everything easy but then its difficult to learn any other
          language in future. As in python you will learn less programming
          concepts than in other languages. You will not learn some major
          concepts like pointers, structures etc.

        <p class="faq-text">
          Nothing is difficult in this just choose one language and then start
          finding its tutorials on Youtube and follow that tutorial and code
          along with it and its better to buy a book and make notes also along
          with that. Still if dont like Youtube then go to Udemy, Udacity or
          Coursera for paid courses. If can't find best I am here to guide you
          and provide what you want just DM
