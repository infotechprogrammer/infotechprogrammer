            If you want to explore all programming concepts deeply then you can learn C++ also for game development. But if you want to make websites so learn JavaScript first, otherwise for android applications or system softwares learn Java first, other than that if you want your future in Data Science and Artifiacial Intelligence then go with python.

            Nothing is difficult in this just choose one language and then start finding its tutorials on Youtube and follow that tutorial and code along with it and its better to buy a book and make notes also along with that. Still if dont like Youtube then go to Udemy, Udacity or Coursera for paid courses.
